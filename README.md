# Ketch Up Demo!

See deployed app here: https://ketchup-demo.netlify.app/

## Demo Changes
For demostration purposes the app was changed to demostrate how the app would function if the app would get verified by google. 

Orginally the app would need access to the users entire google drive to create new sheets and docs.

The demo also removes sending emails making it easier for users to start collaborating.

Furthermore the UI for the chatroom has been revamped and tool tips have been added for icons that were previously absent.
